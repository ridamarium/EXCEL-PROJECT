# EXCEL-PROJECT
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel using Zomato restaurant data. The goal of the project is to analyze restaurant distribution, pricing, ratings, services, and time-based trends through structured tables, calculated columns, pivot tables, slicers, and charts.

This Excel-based project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data cleaning, data modeling, time intelligence, aggregation, and dashboard design.

A country and city-wise restaurant count chart highlights geographical distribution and market concentration. Time-based charts show the number of restaurant openings by year, quarter, and month using a custom calendar table, helping identify growth trends and seasonality. Rating-based charts display the distribution of restaurants across average rating levels to understand customer satisfaction. Price bucket charts group restaurants into reasonable cost ranges to analyze affordability segments. Percentage-based donut charts illustrate the proportion of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services. Additional bar charts analyze restaurant distribution by cuisine type and by city, enabling comparison of popular cuisines and high-density urban markets. Together, these visuals provide a comprehensive view of restaurant presence, pricing strategy, service availability, and customer preferences.
